## Before any questions
Must have:
* [Personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [Good mood](https://context.reverso.net/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4/%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9/good+mood)

In console go to files directory and command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Wait for it. Just a few second... Great!

Now command `python app.py` and try to create simple files: .html, .cpp, etc.
Have fun!

## Smth wrong
There is nothing perfect... 
We dont know why, but our app delete all C/C++ files from folder.
Maybe its just a bug and our QA-team dont understand where is a problem.
OR maybe main developer hate all about C/C++. Who knows...

## With help
- os
- time
- json
- webbrowser
- PIL

## Description
- File with '.html' format will be opening in your browser.
- File with '.jpg' format will be formating to '.png'.
- File with '.c' or '.cpp' format will be DESTROY, LOL.
- All file move to desired folders.
- BONUS INTERACTIVE: if YOU want to create an empty folder I want to play a game with YOU.
Seriously, the app give you some time for create new file in this empty folder, but if you dont have time to do it then the folder will be deleted. 
Good luck, my friend!
